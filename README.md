# Dependencies

In order to run the program, you will need the following:

* Python 3 installed on your machine
* Copy the projects repository to your local machine using CLI

```
git clone https://github.com/danace38/bookbot.git
```

# Executing the program

* Run main.py inside the projects repository

```
python3 main.py <Relative path to a book>
```

If you would like to analyze a different book, you can upload any book in .txt file format to bookbot/books.

* I recommend uploading books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
